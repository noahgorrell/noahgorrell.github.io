title: "Honours Thesis"
excerpt: "This thesis explores the relationship between Fourier and Schur multipliers on second-countable, unimodular groups. We examine Caspers and de la Salle’s result, that for amenable groups there is an equality between the completely bounded norms of these multipliers on their respective noncommutative Lp spaces."
